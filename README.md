# Barbated - Barcode Battler II Editor

This project contains a TypeScript implementation for parsing barcodes according to the card system rules of Barcode Battler II (European version).

## Acknowledgements
This project is based on the information in the [Barcode Battler Museum](https://barcodebattler.co.uk/) and the [Barcode Battler Engine project](https://github.com/VITIMan/barcode-battler-engine). Many thanks and all the credit to the contributors of these projects for their work in reverse engineering the card system and providing valuable insights into the game mechanics.

## Project Structure

*   `src/`: Contains the main source code for the library.
    *   `lib/`: The parsing library code and test data.
    *   `docs/`: Detailed documentation about the card system and parser mapping.
*   `jest.config.js`: Configuration for the Jest testing framework.
*   `package.json`: Defines project dependencies and scripts (like the test script).
*   `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler configuration.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Run tests:**
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
3.  **Run the application locally:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, and you can access the application in your browser at the URL provided (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Notes on Downloaded Card Images

When downloading the generated Barcode Battler cards, please keep the following in mind:

### PNG Downloads (DPI)

The application generates PNG images with the correct pixel dimensions to achieve a resolution of 300 DPI when printed at the standard card size (86mm x 59mm). For example, a card of this size at 300 DPI will have pixel dimensions of approximately 1016x697 pixels.

However, the PNG file itself may not have explicit DPI metadata embedded, or some image viewers and operating systems might default to displaying it or reporting its DPI as a standard screen resolution (e.g., 72 DPI or 96 DPI). This does not mean the image has less detail. As long as the pixel dimensions are correct (e.g., 1016x697), the image contains all the necessary data for a high-quality 300 DPI print at the intended physical size. When using the image in printing software or image editing tools, you can usually specify the desired print size or resolution, which will use the full pixel data available.

### SVG Downloads (Embedded Fonts)

The SVG files generated by the application include the custom "Anton SC" font embedded directly within the file using a base64 encoded data URL. This is done to make the SVG portable and ensure the title text renders correctly in most modern SVG viewers and web browsers without requiring the font to be installed on the system.

However, some vector graphics editors, such as Inkscape, may still have trouble rendering the embedded font correctly or might issue warnings if the font is not also installed locally on your system. If you encounter rendering issues with the font in such software, installing the "Anton SC" font (available in the [`/fonts/Anton_SC/`](./fonts/Anton_SC/) directory of this project) on your system should resolve the problem.
